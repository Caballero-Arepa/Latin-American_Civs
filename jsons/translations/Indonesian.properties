Be welcomed, president.

The conflicts didn't cease until the early 21st century, where the sun finally rises over Colombia to achieve greatness. =

Ay! Greetings Mr. president. You lead the famous and cultured nation of Mexico. On the ruins of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, and on top of the lake, Mexico City stands on what was one of the empires crushed by the Spanish. A heroic independence did not give stability to the wonderful nation, as it's political conflict lead to many unfortunate events, but when it's needed Mexico unites against foreign aggressors and do the best they can. Even with internal struggles, and bad geography, Mexico is one of the most influential cultures of America. =

Oh, great leader of the Mexican republic, your people desperately call you, they call you to bring them once again peace, and glory as well. Will you help your people? Can you transform this nation into the best? Will you create a civilization that stands the test of time? =

Mr. President, welcome.  As you know, you lead the great, ancient, cultural nation of the Peru. The nation dates back to the mighty Incas, after being colonized. The colony was one of the major ones for the Spanish - and that wasn't for no reason -. The ungrateful Spaniards wasted all the money, increased taxes, and combined with many other things, Peru rebelled. After a failed attempt, the joint effort of Simon Bolivar, and most importantly, San Martín, gave the freedom to the Peruvians, which continued to exploit their mineral riches, and culture abundance. =

Great Liberator Simon Bolivar, you have been a great disciplined, one who built this country. Its richness and beauty wonder many countries. The beautiful country born with the first settlers, warriors and fishermen. But our republican history starts when, Francisco de Miranda, a great excellent general, and you, Simon Bolivar, a great strategist and fearless warrior, taking advantage of the weakened position of Spain would proclaim Venezuelan independence. The so dreamed independence would not come until the Battle of Carabobo, glory to the brave people, Venezuela has been born in Carabobo!, and the Venezuelan richness would have a rise in the middle of the 20th century, thanks to their resources. =
