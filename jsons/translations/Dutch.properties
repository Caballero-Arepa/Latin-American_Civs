Be welcomed, president.

Since the start we had a ton of great political division, which brought many, many problems and conflicts, but despite all the troubles, Colombia ought to help others, no matter what. The conflicts didn't cease until the early 21st century, where the sun finally rises over Colombia to achieve greatness. =
