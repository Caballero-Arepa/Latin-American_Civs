Mr. President, welcome.  As you know, you lead the great, ancient, cultural nation of the Peru. The nation dates back to the mighty Incas, after being colonized. The colony was one of the major ones for the Spanish - and that wasn't for no reason -. The ungrateful Spaniards wasted all the money, increased taxes, and combined with many other things, Peru rebelled. After a failed attempt, the joint effort of Simon Bolivar, and most importantly, San Martín, gave the freedom to the Peruvians, which continued to exploit their mineral riches, and culture abundance. =

Colonel Marcos Perez Jimenez, you have been a great disciplined, one who built this country. Its richness and beauty wonder many countries. The beautiful country born with the first settlers, warriors and fishermen. But our republican history starts when, Francisco de Miranda, a great excellent general, and Simon Bolivar, a Venezuelan strategist and fearless warrior, taking advantage of the weakened position of Spain would proclaim Venezuelan independence. The so dreamed independence would not come until the Battle of Carabobo, glory to the brave people, Venezuela has been born in Carabobo!, and the Venezuelan richness would have a rise in the middle of the 20th century, thanks to their resources. =
